# SashSolutions

## Introduction

SashSolutions is designed to streamline the process of generating quotes for custom wood windows. The software caters to window specifications, calculates costs, stores customer details, and outputs generated quotes. Initially tailored for wood windows, it's architected to scale for all types of residential windows.

## Current Status: Refactoring & Overhaul

The software began as a CLI tool. The current objective is to transform it into a web application, complete with a database backend and cloud integration, enhancing its scalability and user experience.

## Key Refactoring Goals:
- **UML Design**: Develop a comprehensive UML diagram to outline the software's architecture, ensuring clarity and proper structure for the transformation.
- **OOP Design & Coding**: Refactor the codebase to adhere strictly to Object-Oriented Programming principles, ensuring modularity and reusability.
- **Database**: Integrate a database to store customer details, quotes, and other relevant data, replacing any file-based storage methods used in the CLI version.
- **Front-End Design**: Develop a modern, responsive front-end to improve user experience and accessibility.
- **Integration & Testing**: Ensure seamless integration of all components and conduct rigorous testing to identify and rectify any issues.
- **Deployment and Development**: Set up an infrastructure for continuous development, testing, and deployment, potentially leveraging cloud services for scalability and performance.
