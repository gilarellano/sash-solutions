### Backend:

1. **Language & Framework**:
    - **Python & Django**: Django is a high-level web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It comes with an admin panel out of the box, which can be useful for managing quotes, users, and other data.
    - **Node.js & Express.js**: A lightweight and flexible server framework that can handle numerous simultaneous client requests efficiently.
2. **Database**:
    - **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It's scalable, reliable, and has a strong community.
    - **MySQL**: Another robust relational database option.
3. **API Communication**:
    - **GraphQL**: A query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing those queries using a type system you define for your data.
    - **RESTful APIs**: Using Django Rest Framework or Express.js.

### Frontend:

1. **Framework & Libraries**:
    - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's component-based, which makes it easy to reuse code and integrate with various backend services.
    - **Vue.js**: Another progressive JavaScript framework that is easy to integrate with projects.
2. **State Management**:
    - **Redux**: Especially if you're using React, Redux can help manage the state of your application more predictably.
    - **Vuex**: For state management in Vue.js applications.
3. **Styling**:
    - **Bootstrap**: For rapid UI development.
    - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

### Deployment & Hosting:

1. **Cloud Providers**:
    - **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Offers a wide range of cloud computing services and has data centers in many parts of the globe.
    - **DigitalOcean**: Known for its simplicity and being developer-friendly.
    - **Heroku**: A cloud platform that offers a simplified deployment process.
2. **Containers**:
    - **Docker**: To containerize your application, ensuring it runs the same regardless of where it's deployed.
    - **Kubernetes**: For orchestration of your Docker containers, especially if you're planning to scale.

### Version Control:

- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for collaboration, version control, and code hosting. It's widely used and has a vast community.

### Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

- **Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions**: Automate your deployment process, ensuring that the main branch is always deployable.

### Collaboration & Project Management:

- **Slack**: For team communication.
- **Trello or Jira**: For task management and tracking.

### Considerations:

1. **User Authentication**: Consider integrating OAuth or JWT for user authentication and authorization.
2. **Security**: Ensure that your application is secure. Use HTTPS, sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injections, and consider using a service like Cloudflare for DDoS protection.
3. **Monolithic vs. Microservices**: Given the current scale, starting with a monolithic architecture would be more straightforward. As you scale and add more features, you can consider breaking it down into microservices.
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation, especially if you're bringing other developers on board.

---

With this design and architecture in mind, the next steps would be:

1. **Prototyping**: Create wireframes or mockups of the user interface.
2. **Development**: Begin coding, starting with the database schema and basic CRUD operations.
3. **Testing**: As features are developed, test them rigorously.
4. **Deployment**: Once the application is stable, deploy it to a live environment.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Continuously gather feedback from users and iterate on the software.
